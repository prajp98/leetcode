Problem: Two Best Non-Overlapping Events

You are given a list of events where each event has a start time, end time, and value.
Your task is to find the maximum sum of values that you can obtain by attending at most two
non-overlapping events.

Example:
Input: events = [[1,3,2], [4,6,5], [2,4,3]]
where each event is [start_time, end_time, value]
Output: 8
Explanation: You can attend events [1,3,2] and [4,6,5] for a total value of 2 + 5 = 7,
or events [2,4,3] and [4,6,5] for a total value of 3 + 5 = 8.
